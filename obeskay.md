# Hey! I'm Obed 👋

I'm a developer from Mexico City who actually builds stuff that works - no buzzwords, just code that solves problems.

## What I do

By day, I'm building web apps with TypeScript and Next.js at an insurance marketplace here in Mexico. By night? I'm usually trying to automate something or experimenting with new tools that don't suck.

I'm fascinated by the intersection of good UX and practical AI - not the hype, but the stuff that actually makes developers' lives easier.

## Current focus

- 🔧 **Making TypeScript less annoying** - because let's be real, types can be a pain sometimes
- 🤖 **AI tools that actually help** - not replacing creativity, but enhancing it
- 🎨 **Bridging design and code** - because Figma handoffs shouldn't be this painful
- 🚀 **Building things people actually use** - shocker, right?

## Some projects I've built

- **n8n workflows** - Because I hate doing the same thing twice
- **Gen-UI experiments** - Testing how far AI can actually go with UI generation
- **Figma MCP bridge** - Making design-to-code less painful, one API call at a time
- **Various automation tools** - For me and for anyone else who hates repetitive tasks

## What I'm NOT doing

- Writing boilerplate code that no one will use
- Chasing the latest framework every week
- Pretending to be "passionate" about APIs (I'm just pragmatic)

I'm always down to chat about building better tools or just swapping stories about what makes coding suck (or not suck) sometimes.
