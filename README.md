# Hey! I'm Obed 👋

Web developer building TypeScript/Next.js applications in Mexico City.

I'm fascinated by the intersection of **clean UX** and **AI tools** - exploring how AI can enhance design workflows without losing the human touch.

## What I'm working on

- 💻 **Day job**: Building web apps with TypeScript/Next.js
- - 🤖 **Side projects**: Experimenting with AI agents and automation tools
  - - 🎨 **Design connection**: Bridging AI capabilities with UX-focused development
   
    - ## Projects I've built
   
    - Check out the pinned repos below - they show my experiments with AI frameworks like CrewAI, AutoGen, and LangGraph, plus some design-to-code tools like the Figma MCP bridge.
   
    - Recently I've been exploring:
    - - **Multi-agent systems** for automating repetitive tasks
      - - **Design-to-code workflows** that maintain design quality
        - - **AI tools** that enhance rather than replace human creativity
